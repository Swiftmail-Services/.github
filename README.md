# Swiftmail ❤️ GitHub

Swiftmail offers customers an easy way to setup and manage a modmail bot in minutes. We found a place on GitHub to offer the community an array of extensive tools to integrate or otherwise boost the Swiftmail experience for developers.

## What can I find here?

You can find our open-sourced repositories for things like modmail plugins or otherwise libraries that offer direct access to our API. We're currently working on expanding our developer tools in addition to the overall product to better improve our relationship with developers. Because of this we do excuse the mess that may be found in our public repositories and will respond promptly to any issues.
